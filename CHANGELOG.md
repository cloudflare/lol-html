## v1.1.0

### Added

- Added ability to get the tag and attribute names with the original casing.

## v1.0.1

### Fixed

- The C API's new `lol_html_element_add_end_tag_handler()` function now sets the last error retrievable by `lol_html_take_last_error()` if it is called on an element that can have no end tag.

## v1.0.0

Yes, you got that right: this is the first 1.x release!  From now on you should expect this project to adhere to
the semantic versioning spec (we have been somewhat relaxed about that in the past).

### Added

* Added `Element::end_tag_handlers()` which allows better control over the end tag handlers.

### Changed

* Removed `Element::on_end_tag()` and `Element::add_on_end_tag()` in favor of the newly added
  `Element::end_tag_handlers()`.

## v0.4.0

### Added

- Added method `TextChunk::as_mut_str()` and `TextChunk::set_str()` for in-place modifications to the text in a
  `TextChunk`. (#175)

### Changed

- Modified method `Element::on_end_tag()` to support multiple handlers. This is a breaking change since the old
  semantics of the method was to overwrite any previously set handler. (#177)

## v0.3.3

### Added

- Support dynamic charset change on meta tags in HtmlRewriter. (#162)
- Add `Element::can_have_content()`. (#163)

## v0.3.2

### Added

- Add `Doctype::remove`. (#129)
- Add `Element::start_tag()` and `Element::is_self_closing()`. (#148)
- Add mutation methods to `StartTag` and `EndTag`. (#148)
- Implement `Eq` for all types that implement `PartialEq`. (#146)

### Fixed

- Changed the HTML parser to more closely match the spec. This only affects rewriters which modify HTML comments. (#128)

## v0.3.1

### Added

- Add `Element::on_end_tag` (#97, #107, #124)

### Changed

- Change string allocators in the C API to return `lol_html_str_t`, not `lol_html_str_t*`. This was necessary to fix a memory leak in `lol_html_str_free`. (#115)
- Update dependencies (#98, #103)

### Fixed

- Fix memory leaks in C API (#113, #115)
